##Sorting

Characteristics:
1. Time Complexity
2. Space Complexity, that is whether the algorithm is in-place or does it use auxiliary memory. For instance, merge sort does use auxiliary temporally and size of memory increase with input size
3. Stability, when two keys are equal the algorithm does not swap them
4. Internal or external (does it use tapes and disks or only RAM)
5. Recursive (merge sort and quick sort) or non-recursive (bubble sort and insertion sort)
